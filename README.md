# Action: release-rust

An all-in-one action to build, optimise, tag, sign, and publish a Cargo-based Rust project.

## Purpose

This action is your one-stop shop for building and publishing a Rust project. It will:
- Install the Rust toolchain and target, including necessary components
- Use [cross] for cross-compilation if needed
- Enable some useful compiler options by default, like:
  + building the standard library (`-Z build-std`),
  + codegen units for maximum optimisations (`-C codegen-units=1`),
  + static linking of libgcc for musl builds (`-C link-arg=-static-libgcc`),
  + outputting split debuginfo (`-C split-debuginfo=packed`).
- Package binaries and support files in an archive
- Sign the archive with [sigstore]
- Tag the release if it isn't already, and sign the tag with sigstore
- Publish the crate to crates.io
- Publish the archives to GitHub Releases

Sounds complicated? Fear not! In most cases, using this action is a 5-line job.

It can be used standalone, as part of your own release workflow, or alongside our own [release-pr]
and [release-meta] actions. See the `onrelease` workflow in the test repo for [a complete example]
of the latter.

[cargo-binstall]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall
[cross]: https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
[sigstore]: https://sigstore.dev

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
```

The action needs no dependencies and runs on all hosted-spec runners (or compatible).

### Checkout

You're responsible for checking out the repository at the right commit for the build. In most cases,
this will be the default behaviour of `actions/checkout@v3`, but in some situations you may need to
specify its `ref` input.

This action also does not bump versions or commit to the repository. You can use [release-pr] for
that if you want a PR-based workflow, push to the repository directly, or use a different tool. It's
up to you.

### Packaging

The `package-archive` input selects the package archive format. For all compressed formats, the
maximum compression setting is used.

| Value | Description |
|:-:|:-|
| `none` | Do not archive the package. This is an advanced option, and you should use `post-package-command` alongside it, otherwise you may not have anything to upload. |
| `zip` | ZIP archive, with DEFLATE compression. This is the default, as it has the widest compatibility. |
| `tar+gzip` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with GZIP compression. |
| `tar+bzip2` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with BZIP2 compression. |
| `tar+xz` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with XZ compression. |
| `tar+zstd` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with ZSTD compression. |

There's no support to select different formats based on the target: if you wish to, you should make
that logic yourself in the workflow, prior to calling this action.

The `package-name` input is a template string that will be used to name the package. The following
placeholders can be used:

- `{target}`: The target being built for.

- `{crate}`: The name of the crate being built. If all crates are being built, this will be
  the name of the first binary crate in lexicographic order. If the `crates` input is given, this
  will be the name of the first crate in the resolved list.

- `{version}`: The version of the crate being built. If all crates are being built, this will be
  the version of the first binary crate in lexicographic order. If the `crates` input is given, this
  will be the version of the first crate in the resolved list.

The `package-separately` option affects the above, as each crate will be packaged separately. See
the [With multiple crates](#with-multiple-crates) section for more details.

## Outputs

All outputs of a Github Action are strings.

| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| `files` | Newline-separated list of files generated by the action. This does not include all built files, only those within the `package-output` path. |

## Behaviour

### Signing

### Hooks

(describe lifecycle/flow)

(hooks run even if their section is disabled, so can be used as replacement functionality)

### Custom build

(TODO: document expected output, e.g. binaries in target/...)

### With multiple crates

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example runs when pull requests tagged with a `release` label are merged to the `main` branch.

It builds the project for six targets (x64 and ARM64 for the big three platforms) and otherwise uses
all defaults: compiles with `build-std`, packs the debuginfo, uses zip archives, publishes to crates.io,
pushes a tag, publishes to GitHub releases, and uploads signatures to sigstore. The binaries can then
be securely installed with [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall].

```yaml
name: Release on PR merge
on:
  pull_request:
    types: closed
    branches: [main] # target branch of release PRs

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release')
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
```

### Running on tags

This example runs when a version tag is pushed. While the action would detect the tag exists before pushing it,
we disable tag publishing to save a little time. Otherwise it does everything the above example does.

```yaml
name: Release on tag push
on:
  push:
    tag: v*.*.*

jobs:
  release:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
        publish-tag: false
```

### Installing compile-time dependencies

Here we build a project that requires [compiler-rt] (provided in Ubuntu by `libblocksruntime-dev`), but only for the
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target. The [post-setup hook](#hooks) is used to install the dependency after the action
finishes setting up the build environment.

[compiler-rt]: https://compiler-rt.llvm.org

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    post-setup: |
      if [ "${{ runner.os }}" = "Linux" ] && [ "${{ matrix.target }}" = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl" ]; then
        sudo apt install -y libblocksruntime-dev # for compiler-rt
      fi
```

### Custom build: justfile

Here we have [a project][cargo-binstall] that uses [just] to build the project. The [post-setup hook](#hooks) is also
used here to install the `just` CLI tool, it does so using [cargo-binstall] which is installed by the action as part of
setup. Because `custom-build` is used, the action won't install the `rust-src` component by default, so we add it
manually as well.

[just]: https://just.systems

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    extra-rustup-components: rust-src
    post-setup: |
      cargo binstall -y --force just
      just ci-install-deps
    custom-build: just build
```

### Custom build: meson

Here's a hypothetical configuration for [a project][pods] which uses [meson] to build. The [post-setup hook](#hooks) is
used to install meson, and the project's dependencies. Finally, the `package-files` option is used to gather the build
outputs to package, as the meson build won't have put anything in the places the action expects to find them. Note that
this example doesn't provide a `crates-token`, so the action won't publish to crates.io.

[meson]: https://mesonbuild.com
[pods]: https://github.com/marhkb/pods

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    post-setup: |
      sudo apt install -y meson ninja appstream-glib glib2 gtk4 libadwaita libpanel gtksourceview vte-2.91-gtk4
      meson _build --prefix=/usr/local
    custom-build: ninja -C _build
    package-files: |
      _build/src/pods
      _build/po
      _build/data/*
```

### Compile out panic messages

(use extra flags to set build-std=abort etc)

### Universal binaries on macOS

(use release-lipo action to combine binaries post-release)

### Multiple crates with globs

### Publish all crates that need publishing

### Publishing to crates.io before or after packaging anything

(TODO: dependent job before/after the action, disable publish-crate)

### Extra signing attestations

(with extra cosign flags)

### Distribute signatures alongside packages

(use extra cosign flags to write sig to outside, use post-package hook to bring sig files back in)

### Sign using GPG instead

(disable sigstore, using post-sign hook to sign and write sig to outside, use post-package hook to bring sig files back in)

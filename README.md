# Action: release-rust

An all-in-one action to build, optimise, tag, checksum, sign, and publish a Cargo-based Rust project.

## Purpose

This action...

The action can be used standalone, as part of your own release workflow, or alongside our own
[release-pr] and [release-meta] actions. See the `onrelease` workflow in the test repo for
[a complete example](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-release-pr-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/onrelease.yml)
of the latter.

[release-pr]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/release-pr
[release-meta]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/release-meta

## Usage

```yaml
name: Release build
on:
  pull_request:
    types: closed
    branches: [main] # target branch of release PRs

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release')
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust
     with:
       github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
       target: ${{ matrix.t }}
```

The action needs no dependencies and runs on all hosted-spec runners (or compatible).

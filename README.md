# Action: release-rust

An all-in-one action to build, optimise, tag, sign, and publish a Cargo-based Rust project.

## Purpose

This action is your one-stop shop for building and publishing a Rust project. It will:
- Install the Rust toolchain and target, including necessary components
- Use [cross] for cross-compilation if needed
- Enable some useful compiler options by default, like:
  + building the standard library (`-Z build-std`),
  + codegen units for maximum optimisations (`-C codegen-units=1`),
  + static linking of libgcc for musl builds (`-C link-arg=-static-libgcc`),
  + outputting split debuginfo (`-C split-debuginfo=packed`).
- Package binaries and support files in an archive
- Sign the archive with [sigstore]'s [cosign]
- Tag the release if it isn't already, and sign the tag with sigstore
- Publish the crate to crates.io
- Publish the archives to GitHub Releases

It can be used standalone, as part of your own release workflow, or alongside our own [release-pr]
and [release-meta] actions. See the `onrelease` workflow in the test repo for [a complete example]
of the latter.

Sounds complicated? Fear not! In most cases, using this action is the job of only few lines of YAML:

[release-pr]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/release-pr
[release-meta]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/release-meta
[a complete example]: https://github.com/passcod/cargo-release-pr-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/onrelease.yml
[cargo-binstall]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall
[cross]: https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
[sigstore]: https://sigstore.dev
[cosign]: https://github.com/sigstore/cosign

## Usage

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write

steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
```

The action needs no dependencies and runs on all hosted-spec runners (or compatible).

### Github token permissions

The github token needs to have:
- `write` permission for `id-token` (OIDC for signing)
- `write` permission for `contents` (releases and tags)

### Checkout

You're responsible for checking out the repository at the right commit for the build. In most cases,
this will be the default behaviour of `actions/checkout@v3`, but in some situations you may need to
specify its `ref` input.

This action also does not bump versions or commit to the repository. You can use [release-pr] for
that if you want a PR-based workflow, push to the repository directly, or use a different tool. It's
up to you.

### Packaging

The `package-archive` input selects the package archive format. For all compressed formats, the
maximum compression setting is used.

| Value | Description |
|:-:|:-|
| `none` | Do not archive the package. This is an advanced option, and you should use `post-package-command` alongside it, otherwise you may not have anything to upload. |
| `zip` | ZIP archive, with DEFLATE compression. This is the default, as it has the widest compatibility. |
| `tar+gzip` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with GZIP compression. |
| `tar+bzip2` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with BZIP2 compression. |
| `tar+xz` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with XZ compression. |
| `tar+zstd` | Posix (pax) TAR archive, with ZSTD compression. |

There's no support to select different formats based on the target: if you wish to, you should make
that logic yourself in the workflow, prior to calling this action.

The `package-name` input is a template string that will be used to name the package. The following
placeholders can be used:

- `{target}`: The target being built for.

- `{crate}`: The name of the crate being built. If all crates are being built, this will be
  the name of the first binary crate in lexicographic order. If the `crates` input is given, this
  will be the name of the first crate in the resolved list.

- `{version}`: The version of the crate being built. If all crates are being built, this will be
  the version of the first binary crate in lexicographic order. If the `crates` input is given, this
  will be the version of the first crate in the resolved list.

The `package-separately` option affects the above, as each crate will be packaged separately. See
the [With multiple crates](#with-multiple-crates) section for more details.

## Outputs

All outputs of a Github Action are strings.

| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| `files` | Newline-separated list of files generated by the action. This does not include all built files, only those within the `package-output` path. |

## Behaviour

### Signing

### Hooks

(describe lifecycle/flow)

Hooks run in different working directories:

| Hook | Working directory |
|:-:|:-|
| `post-setup` | Runs in the working directory of the action (usually the top of the repo). |
| `custom-build` | Runs in the working directory of the action. |
| `post-build` | Runs in the working directory of the action. |
| `pre-package` | Runs in a temporary directory filled with the built binaries and other `package-files`. |
| `post-package` | Runs in the `package-output` directory. |
| `post-sign` | Runs in the `package-output` directory. |
| `post-publish` | Runs in the working directory of the action. |

(hooks run even if their section is disabled, so can be used as replacement functionality)

### Custom build

(TODO: document expected output, e.g. binaries in target/...)

### With multiple crates

### Crates.io publish only mode

When `publish-crate-only` is `true`, the action will only publish to crates.io. This is useful in
some cases like [splitting the crates.io publish and the rest](#publishing-to-cratesio-before-or-after-packaging-anything)
as the toolchain setup can then be easily kept consistent between the two jobs.

In that mode:
- The toolchain setup is performed, but without any default components.
- The `post-setup` and `post-publish` hooks are run, if set.
- Everything else is skipped: other hooks, the build, packaging, tagging, the release, etc.
- The action will fail if the crate is already published at that version (in normal mode, such
  failures are ignored).

If you want to _only_ publish to crates.io and _not_ then package the binaries, you should not use
this action, and do something like this instead:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- run: |
    rustup toolchain install stable --profile minimal --no-self-update
    rustup default stable
- run: cargo publish
```

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example runs when pull requests tagged with a `release` label are merged to the `main` branch.

It builds the project for six targets (x64 and ARM64 for the big three platforms) and otherwise uses
all defaults: compiles with `build-std`, packs the debuginfo, uses zip archives, publishes to
crates.io, pushes a tag, publishes to GitHub releases, and uploads signatures to sigstore. The
binaries can then be securely installed with [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall].

```yaml
name: Release on PR merge
on:
  pull_request:
    types: closed
    branches: [main] # target branch of release PRs

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release')
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
```

### Running on tags

This example runs when a version tag is pushed. While the action would detect the tag exists before
pushing it, we disable tag publishing to save a little time. Otherwise it does everything the above
example does.

```yaml
name: Release on tag push
on:
  push:
    tag: v*.*.*

jobs:
  release:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
        publish-tag: false
```

### Installing compile-time dependencies

Here we build a project that requires [compiler-rt] (provided in Ubuntu by `libblocksruntime-dev`),
but only for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target. The [post-setup hook] is used to install the
dependency after the action finishes setting up the build environment.

[post-setup hook]: #hooks
[compiler-rt]: https://compiler-rt.llvm.org

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    post-setup: |
      if [ "${{ runner.os }}" = "Linux" ] && [ "${{ matrix.target }}" = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl" ]; then
        sudo apt install -y libblocksruntime-dev # for compiler-rt
      fi
```

### Custom build: justfile

Here we have [a project][cargo-binstall] that uses [just] to build the project. A [post-setup hook]
is also used here to install the `just` CLI tool: it does so using [cargo-binstall] which is
installed by the action as part of setup. Because `custom-build` is used, the action won't install
the `rust-src` component by default, so we add it manually as well.

[just]: https://just.systems

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    extra-rustup-components: rust-src
    post-setup: |
      cargo binstall -y --force just
      just ci-install-deps
    custom-build: just build
```

### Custom build: meson

Here's a hypothetical configuration for [a project][pods] which uses [meson] to build. A
[post-setup hook] is used to install meson, and the project's dependencies. Finally, the
`package-files` option is used to gather the build outputs to package, as the meson build won't have
put anything in the places the action expects to find them. Note that this example doesn't provide a
`crates-token`, so the action won't publish to crates.io.

[meson]: https://mesonbuild.com
[pods]: https://github.com/marhkb/pods

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    post-setup: |
      sudo apt install -y meson ninja appstream-glib glib2 gtk4 libadwaita libpanel gtksourceview vte-2.91-gtk4
      meson _build --prefix=/usr/local
    custom-build: ninja -C _build
    package-files: |
      _build/src/pods
      _build/po
      _build/data/*
```

### Compile out panic messages

While this is not an optimisation that is on by default, it can be useful to reduce the size of
binaries. By passing a few extra flags, we can instruct the compiler to remove all panic messages
from the binary. This is done by forcing `panic = "abort"` in the release profile and enabling the
immediate-abort-on-panic feature for `build-std`:

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    extra-cargo-flags: |
      --config='profile.release.panic="abort"'
      -Z build-std=std,panic_abort
      -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```

### Universal binaries on macOS

A macOS concept is [universal binaries], which contain code for multiple architectures. This action
cannot build these directly, but the companion [release-lipo] action will read from an existing
release, download `*-apple-darwin` packages and extract them, combine the binaries with [`lipo`],
then repackage and upload the result:

[universal binaries]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary
[release-lipo]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/release-lipo
[`lipo`]: https://ss64.com/osx/lipo.html

```yaml
name: Release on tag push
on:
  push:
    tag: v*.*.*

jobs:
  release:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
        publish-tag: false

  lipo:
    needs: release
    runs-on: macos-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-lipo@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Filtering crates

Within a workspace, sometimes only a subset of crates should be build and packaged. This set of
crates is adjustable with the `crates` option, which takes a newline-separated list of crate names:

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    crates: |
      my-crate
      my-other-crate
```

When there are many crates with similar names, you can use glob patterns to match them:

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    crates: |
      *-cli
      other-tool
```

How this works is that the action will run `cargo metadata` to get a list of all crates in the
workspace, then filter that list by the glob patterns.

You can also use negative patterns to exclude crates:

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    crates: |
      *-cli
      !not-this-cli
```

You should take care to [read through the behaviour section for multiple crate publishing](#with-multiple-crates).
Notably, you may want to set the first crate in the list explicitly as it may affect names and tags.

### Filtering binaries

By default, all binaries in the workspace, or in the set of crates being built, will be packaged. To
filter these, use the `pre-package` hook to run a script that will remove unwanted binaries:

```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
    target: ${{ matrix.target }}
    pre-package: |
      rm -r example{-,_}tool{,.*}
```

The `{-,_}` and `{,.*}` expressions will match both the binary on unix and windows, and the
debuginfo packages for that binary, without matching files that start with the same thing, like
`example-tool*` would.

### Publish all crates that need publishing

(only concerns crates.io publishing, all crates (or all `crates`) will be built/packaged regardless)

### Publishing to crates.io before or after packaging anything

You may want to control _when_ the crate is published to crates.io, or stop the release if it fails.
This cannot be done directly with this action, as by nature it will run in parallel across the job's
target matrix. However, you can set up a dependent job that runs before or after the release job:

```yaml
name: Release on tag push
on:
  push:
    tag: v*.*.*

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        crates-token: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}
        publish-crate-only: true

  release:
    needs: publish
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: x86_64-apple-darwin        }
        - { o: macos-latest,    t: aarch64-apple-darwin       }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  }
        - { o: ubuntu-latest,   t: aarch64-unknown-linux-musl }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc     }
        - { o: windows-latest,  t: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc    }

    name: ${{ matrix.t }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.o }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cargo-bins/release-rust@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        target: ${{ matrix.t }}
        publish-tag: false
        publish-crate: false
```

You should take note of [the particular behaviour of the `publish-crate-only` option](#cratesio-publish-only-mode).

### Extra signing attestations

(with extra cosign flags)

### Distribute signatures alongside packages

(use extra cosign flags to write sig to outside, use post-package hook to bring sig files back in)

### Sign using GPG instead

(disable sigstore, using post-sign hook to sign and write sig to outside, use post-package hook to bring sig files back in)
